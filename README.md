# Phishing-Website-Detection

## INTRODUCTION:
The Internet has become an indispensable part of our life; However, it also has provided
opportunities to anonymously perform malicious activities like Phishing. Phishers try to deceive their
victims by social engineering or creating mock-up websites to steal information such as account ID,
username, password from individuals and organizations. Although many methods have been
proposed to detect phishing websites, Phishers have evolved their methods to escape from these
detection methods. One of the most successful methods for detecting these malicious activities is
Machine Learning. This is because most Phishing attacks have some common characteristics which
can be identified by machine learning methods.
